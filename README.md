# C - Binary Trees Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on binary trees in C, emphasizing data structures, algorithms, and understanding the concepts related to binary trees. The project is to be completed in teams of two people, with work starting on Feb 26, 2024, and ending by Mar 1, 2024.

## Concepts
The following concepts are crucial for this project:
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Time Complexity compared to Linked Lists
- Depth, Height, and Size of a Binary Tree
- Traversal methods in a Binary Tree
- Complete, Full, Perfect, and Balanced Binary Trees

For a deeper understanding, read or watch the provided resources on binary trees.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain what a binary tree is.
- Differentiate between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree (BST).
- Understand the time complexity gain compared to linked lists.
- Define the depth, height, and size of a binary tree.
- Implement different traversal methods in a binary tree.
- Describe the characteristics of complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary trees.

## Copyright - Plagiarism
Ensure that all solutions are original and avoid plagiarism. Do not publish any content related to this project.

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specific options.
- Code should follow the Betty style.
- No global variables allowed.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- Prototypes of functions should be included in the header file named `binary_trees.h`.
- Header files should be include guarded.

### GitHub
- Create one project repository per group.
- Avoid cloning/forking a project repository with the same name before the second deadline.

### Data Structures
- Use the provided data structures and types for binary trees: `binary_tree_t`, `bst_t`, `avl_t`, `heap_t`.

### Print Function
- A print function is provided for visualization purposes. It is not required to push it to your repo.

## Instructions for Compilation
- Compile your code on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the provided options.

## Instructions for Testing
- You can use the provided `main.c` files to test your functions, but do not push them to your repo.
